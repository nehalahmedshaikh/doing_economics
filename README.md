# Doing Economics: MATLAB Implementations of Empirical Projects

[CORE's textbook](https://www.core-econ.org/doing-economics/) features 12 analysis-intensive projects based on empirical data. These projects are of immense value to anyone who wants to master the tools of data handling, data cleaning, and transferable software and statistical skills. Each project is roughly considered as a term-long assignment and is composed of various tasks revolving around its central theme. The instructions provided in the book are specifically for Google Sheets, Microsoft Excel, and R. Here I have followed those instructions to implement the projects [currently 4/12] in MATLAB, which is a widely used programming langugae for data analysis. For convenience, the data sets are also provided with each project. Inspiration for this endeavor is taken from the [complete set](https://github.com/aeturrell/core_python) produced in Python by [Dr. Arthur Turrell](https://aeturrell.com/).
